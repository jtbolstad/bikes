# Bikes - a small app that consumes bysykkel-APIs.

Prerequisites: yarn or npm must be installed.

Install dependencies by running yarn or npm in the repository folder.

In the project directory, run `yarn start` (or `npm start`).

This starts the app in the development mode, and should open it in a browser window.

If not, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
